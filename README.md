# ˊ・ω・ˋ Emacs~~
This is an init file for non-programmer. Without any warranty surely because this is just for my personal usage. =w=+

## Installation

>If `~/.emacs.d` existed already, please backup it first.

```shell
cd ~ && git clone https://github.com/kuanyui/.emacs.d && cd .emacs.d && ./setup-emacs.sh
```

If you encounter problem after installing packages, runs `emacs --load ./auto-install-packages.el` manually again (or more times).
